          <p>Hi, I’m Anna Theresa and I’m an Educational Coordinator, Mentor, Wrestler and Pageant Queen.</p>
            <p>As an <b>Educational Coordinator and Mentor</b> with <em>The Child Center of NY</em>, I believe it is extremely important to provide counseling, educational, health and family support for our community. Please click here to find out more about what we do or donate as well!</p>
            <p><b>Pageanting</b> is something I love doing as I find it inspirational, uplifting and honorable. It is a great platform to talk about current issues and to help promote The Child Center of NY. Please click here to follow my pageant page.</p>
            <p><b>Wrestling</b> is a wonderful passion I discovered as a fan. I have now become a dedicated performer and wrestling is a big part of my life. It's a great way to boost confidence, get that cardio going and is just plain fun! Click here to see any performances I may have coming up.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
